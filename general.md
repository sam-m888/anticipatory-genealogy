# Anticipatory Genealogy

Providing a rich and fulfilling genealogy experience to every person by giving them what they want, when they need it, presented in a way they understand, completely unique and personalized to them.

## Introduction

Let's face it, doing family history sucks until you are an experienced genealogist. Newcomers are presented with a dizzying set of options, a wall of jargon, and a mountain of principles, resources, and methodologies to master before they can feel productive. And attaining that mastery takes time and persistence, mistakes and practice. This makes genealogy unforgiving and uninviting to all but the most dedicated of learners.

And what about you? What if you have no desire to become an experienced genealogist? What if you just want to learn a little about your grandfather? What if you are a history buff that wants to learn about history in the context of your ancestors? What if you're just interested in exploring your past and helping out where you can? What then?

Until now you have been forced to choose. To decide what you want up front. To seek out what you need. To adapt yourself to the software you chose. You had to reach out, learn, and explore all on your own.

It is time for something different. Something that learns what you want. Something that grows with you. Something that instructs, adapts, and changes based on what you do and say. Something that anticipates you.

This is what anticipatory genealogy is all about. It asks what you want to do. It guides you while you do it. It learns from you as you do it. It knows what you want, goes out and gets it, and brings it to you. It presents genealogy to you in the way you understand, knowing the goals you have in mind.

These goals vary from person to person. Let's meet a few of these people...

## Let's Meet Some People

First there is Bob. He is a 30 year old male that is comfortable with computers, is a bit of a history buff, and loves learning about his ancestors in the context of history. He doesn't much care for expanding his tree, but loves to get distracted reading about what his ancestors experienced.

And then there is Sue. She is a puzzle master, and does the daily crossword. She is 38, is married with 2 children, and is hooked on matching families with records. Give her a daily feed of discrete, bite sized relationship puzzles and she's as happy as a clam. If they are about her own family that's a bonus, but it's more about the puzzle than the person.

Now take Sally. She is the quintessential genealogist. Semi-retired at age 54, she is an experienced amateur contemplating certification. She has more notes that you can shake a stick at, and loves compiling formal genealogies about her own family. She attends every conference she can, and is learning to read Latin.

And finally Bill. He is 16 and owns a smart phone but not a computer. He is curious about his grandparents, and would like to find his great grandparents, but doesn't quite know where to start. He doesn't want to devote the hours-at-a-time it would take to dig in and learn, so he asks for guidance and help to both do and learn genealogy.

Sally, Bill, Sue, and Bob all have different backgrounds and want different things. They have varying levels of comfort with computers/technology, and their experience with genealogy and family history is all over the charts. Let's take a look at what anticipatory genealogy might look like for each of them...

Sally logs onto her computer and is presented with the list of projects she is working on, with a notification saying she has 2 messages. She opens the first, and reads that Tom, a researcher she was working with, has added some information to his tree supporting the death date and place of an ancestor that they have in common. She glances at the notes and citations, and pulls that information into her tree with a quick button click. The next message is a note from Bess. She found some information that seems to conflict with what Sally has in her tree, and wants to discuss possibilities. Sally pulls up her tree and looks at the conflict in context with both the new and old information, and notices an alert telling her that there is another discussion happening about the same piece of information. Someone must have found a high possibility conflict and brought it to the attention of those who shared the same ancestor. After adding her two-cents and "watching" the conversation, she returns to her home screen. There she sees that the system found another non-indexed record set that may shed some light on one of her projects. She pulls up that project and takes a look at her task list. 5 of 7 record sets searched. Yesterday there were only 6. Time to dive in and research, and she does...

Bill sits down for a break between his classes and pulls out his phone. There is a notification reminding him about his daily goal to do genealogy, and he clicks it. Today's task is figuring out if two people on two different census's 10 years apart are one and the same. High, medium, and low probability are the possible answers for this one. The names are the same, as are the birth countries, but the birth years are way off. As he learned to do yesterday, he pulls up the family comparison and sees that all but one family member matches. The oldest daughter is not on the latter census. He notices that she was 14 on the last census, and it would make sense that she would be gone 10 years latter. He selects "high probability", knowing that this will feed into the pool of available matches for others to verify and eventually use. Checking to make sure he has time for another, he starts reading. The names are spelled different, but sound the same...

Sue pulls out her tablet and opens up her current person-place puzzle. She has about 10 minutes before her youngest gets done with dance practice. The concept is easy enough, just match up all of the people into families for a given place. "Good. 32/70 complete. Hmm. Anne born to John and Mary Smith. Elizabeth born to John and Mary Smith. Looks like just under 2 years apart, an easy one. Hyrum born to John and Anne Smith, but no other children for that couple. And a death of Anne Smith just after. And a Hyrum Smith. Oh, how sad. It's wondering if it's the same John Smith? Let me just check the timeline. Only two John Smith's in total, and there is a few years between John/Anne and John/Mary. High Probability. And his new wife named the first daughter after his old wife. How touching..."

Bob leans back from his computer and stretches. Lunch break. He pulls out a muffin and cracks open his salad. "Oh good, grilled chicken. And she added avocados. Mmmmm." He logs on and selects Continue Reading.
> Your grandfather also fought in the Battle of Clervaux as a member of the American 110th Regiment on 16 December 1944 â€“ 18 December 1944 in Clervaux, northern Luxembourg. From Wikipedia: German forces of the Fifth Panzer Army under Hasso von Manteuffel's command, primarily from the 2nd Panzer Division...

"Hmm. Hasso von Manteuffel. Sounds familiar. Oh look, Bastogne. That's where I remember him from. Hey Joe! Come and take a look at this..."

Each person is doing genealogy in a way completely unique to their goals and backgrounds. The system has learned what they like to do and what they want to do, and is presenting that to each of them. Each person is learning, having fun, and making a difference.

And each person is helping the others in some way. Bill's learning and Sue's puzzles feed Sally's research, which allows Bob to enjoy learning about his relatives in the context of history. Each Person, with their own unique want and desire, contributes to the whole, and all benefit. All because each person's experience was tailored to their wants and adapted to their needs. And the more it learned about them and their ancestors, the more it is able to provide. Each new piece of information builds on the one prior, and each person provides more detail and information to draw from.

Now that we know a little about what Anticipatory Genealogy looks like, let's learn more about how it works...

## Underlying Concepts

Anticipatory Genealogy is all about adapting genealogy to a person. The mechanism for doing this is a continuous cycle between Tasks and Results.

![](img/simple-cycle.png)

A Person is presented with a lists of Tasks. These might be things like "Search this record set for the birth information of Ancestor X", "Learn how to match people across multiple Census's.", "Match up all the families in Place Y", or "Read about your grandfather's role in World War 2". It may also be something like "How comfortable are you reading Ship Manifests?", "What area of your tree are you most interested in expanding?", or "How much time would you like to devote to genealogy every week?". And each time a Task is complete the Result of that Task is recorded by the system and used when presenting additional Tasks.

As more and more tasks are completed, the system presents tasks more and more in-line with the Person wants, is good at, and actually does. The experience for the Person becomes very personal and unique to them. Remember, the overall purpose of Anticipatory Genealogy is to adapt to and anticipate the Person's goals, wants, and desires, presenting them with information and tasks that help them meed their goals/wants/desires.

Now let's take a closer look at how Anticipatory Genealogy works in a few different scenarios.

### Anticipatory Genealogy in Practice

In each scenario the system knows a great deal about what each person's overall goals are and what they want to/enjoy doing. It uses this information to tailor its interface to each person, and to present them with tasks that move them toward their goal. Lets examine each Person's unique situation and interaction with the system.

#### Traditional Research

The system knows that Sally is a more experienced genealogist and wants to do traditional research. It knows that she is fairly comfortable with technology, uses a Windows desktop most of the time, and an iPad on occasion. In examining her tree, the system has identified several locations where Sally could focus her research, but knows that she prefers focusing on her maternal grandmother's line. It knows that she is comfortable with reading English records, will actually dive in and search non-indexed records, and maintains accounts on several popular genealogy sites. She likes to bounce between a few projects at a time, prefers a traditional research-log approach, and always wants to be informed of any updates or information related to her mother's ancestry.

When Sally logs into the system, she is presented with 2 main sections on her home screen. The first section contains updates, communications, and things that have happened since the last time she logged in. Any changes or updates to her mother's ancestry would appear here, and clicking on them would show Sally what she has and what the new information is. She would be able to discuss the change, ignore it, or pull it into her own tree right from that screen. Communications and messages would also appear here, like discussions Sally is participating in, messages directed at Sally, and questions from the system asking for preferences or clarifications. The system also suggest areas of research that Sally may be interested in, such as a new research project to find her grandmothers aunt's children.

The second section contains a list of Sally's current projects. Since Sally is more of a traditional genealogist, her projects are organized in a more traditional research log format. Each project is focused on a specific ancestor or family, and contains a list of questions that need to be answered and a list of records/sources that need to be searched. Each record/source line contains both the information that describes it and where to search it, as well as the specific information that Sally is looking for. There is also a place for notes, and any information she enters is linked to her tree automatically. Sally can also add new sources or questions to answer at any time.

When Sally opens up a project, it gives her a small summary of what she completed last time, and recommends the next task to complete or record to search. Since the entire project is linked into her tree, she can view her research in the context of her family, and can also collaborate on her research process with her friend Bess. Both her tree and her research can be shared with anyone, and discussions happen in the context of what they are referencing, with applicable information being pulled in or linked automatically.

The system is always working behind the scenes on Sally's behalf. It keeps track of what Sally is working on, and focuses its efforts on finding information and sources that may be of use to her in those areas. It scans other linked trees and notifies her of any discussions that may be of value. It looks for new records that just became available that may contain more information about what she is researching, and automatically adds those to existing research logs for her to search. And the system always tailors it's communications to her knowing that she is a more experienced genealogist and is primarily focused on traditional research. The system adapts to and anticipates Sally, providing her with an experience that is unique to her, as any Anticipatory Genealogy system should.

#### Learning About Research

The system knows that Bill is not an experienced genealogist, but is ready and willing to learn. It knows that he has only ever logged on via his phone, and only stays on for an average of 6.2 minutes at a time. It knows that he has uploaded a small tree, but has not tried to update or add to it directly. The system knows that he wants to expand his tree, but doesn't know where to start. It knows that Bill has only logged into the system and viewed his home page twice. The only thing it contains is a list of the daily notifications that he receives on his phone, and a description of his goal to learn enough to find out about his great grandparents.

Every day at 10:00 am the system sends a notification to his phone with a reminder about his daily genealogy goal. When he clicks on it, his daily lesson opens up. Each lesson is intended to either introduce a concept, like how to read a census, or practical practice, like determining how likely it is that two people on two census' are the same person. Each lesson task is small and focused, intended to teach one concept and be completed in under 5 minutes. The material comes from a mix of hand crafted introductions and system generated practical exercises. Behind the scenes the system has put together sets of probable matches, and uses the learning system to validate many of them. These matches eventually find their way onto the home screens of those people who are interested in doing research to expand their tree.

The system is slowly teaching Bill how to do genealogy. When he is ready, it will start injecting research log tasks for his own tree into his daily notifications. It will also ask Bill more questions about what he would like to do, like learning about his ancestors in the context of history or solving more complicated puzzles than simple census person matching. It will continue to adapt and learn about Bill, providing him with a unique genealogy experience.

#### Person-Place Puzzles

The system knows that Sue has no interest in doing traditional genealogy. She is interested in helping others, but she doesn't like traditional research. What she does like is puzzles, and fortunately genealogy provides an almost unlimited supply of those. After being given several choices as to the type of puzzle, Sue informed the system that she prefers person-place puzzles. The system presents all of the people in a given place over a period of time and the goal is to arrange them into families.

As often as she can, Sue logs into the system and works on Person-Place puzzles. She has no tree uploaded, although the option is there. She has the choice of census-based, church-based, or will-based puzzles to choose from, in a variety of difficulties. Her task is to rate each family connection as high, medium, or low probability, and to use all available people in a particular place. She knows that this information goes to feed suggestions and hints for other people's genealogy, and she is proud of that fact.

The system is presenting as many interesting puzzles as it can to Sue, so that it can grow its available pool of information to help those who want to do traditional genealogy. Every once in a while it will check with Sue to see if she wants to do something else as well, but it will keep her supplied with puzzles for as long as she will stay. And if Sue ever uploads her tree, it will send her a puzzle or two that has her own ancestors in it, and will make sure to point that out. The system will continue to provide a personalized experience for Sue and will give her hours and hours of fun and challenging puzzles.

#### Ancestors in History

The system knows that Bob wants to learn about history in the context of his own ancestors. It knows that he prefers media rich events, and spends the majority of his time diving into war related connections. It knows that Bob logs on from two main locations, one at about noon on most weekdays for about 45 minutes and the other only on the weekends for an average of an hour. It has examined his tree, and has identified several ancestors who may have participated in major events. After confirming this with Bob (and adding that information to his tree), it created a list of major events that his ancestors participated in, would have experienced, or knew about.

When Bob logs into the system his home page is filled with images and clips from moments in history, titled and referencing the particular ancestor or family that was involved. At the top was the last thing that Bob was reading so he can return to it easily. Bob also has the option to filter history based on location, time, and type of event, and can generate an ancestor or family reading/watch list whenever he wants. He can also share any of these with his family or friends with the click of a button.

The system is giving Bob as many avenues as possible to let him learn about his ancestors and how history formed around them. It occasionally presents a different type of story or experience to see if Bob is interested in that type, but it primarily curates stories and experiences that are in line with Bob's specific preferences. It will prompt him to add detail to his tree when appropriate, but only in the context of a historical event related to that piece of suggested information. Over time the system will continue to curate and provide experiences that are more and more customized to his tastes and preferences, providing a rich and engaging experience.

## So What?

So what if we have a system that adapts to users. What's the big deal?

There are many advantages to a system that learns and adapts to the wants and needs of the people who use it. One of the major ones is that it is much more approachable for a larger range of people. Not everyone is, or wants to become, a traditional genealogist. Some just want to solve puzzles or learn about their ancestors in history. And for those who want to work on and expand their trees and personal genealogies, having a system that adapts to their level of skill is a big deal. It can keep people engaged and feeling productive from the beginning, and can help and assist them as they learn and grow. It can help them learn, and do so in the context of their own ancestors, personalizing any training to the.

Another advantage is the inherent connection and re-engagement with the system and overall experience. When a person invests in something and it becomes their own, they are much more likely to stay and continue to engage. They feel a sense of ownership, and combined with the fact that a person's ancestors belong to the person, makes for a very strong bond with the overall experience. A system that tailors and adapts itself to someone is much more enjoyable and enduring than a system that forces you to adapt to it.

And while there are many other obvious advantages that you can see, it is worth mentioning one more. A system that attracts a large range of people will become rich and [information packed], attracting even more people to it. It becomes a driver of continual engagement and growth, where the more people who use and participate, the more there is for people to do and participate in. Each person contributes their own knowledge and information to the whole, and the whole benefits from and can provide more knowledge and information to the Person as a result. And the system provides a deeper and more personalized experience over time, engaging so many more people that it otherwise could.

Which brings us to the point of Anticipatory Genealogy. To provide a rich and fulfilling genealogy experience for every person by giving them what they want, when they need it, presented in a way they understand, completely unique and personalized to them. This is what is needed. This is what we must create. This is what we must give to every person. This is Anticipatory Genealogy.
