# Anticipatory Genealogy

# Introduction?

Genealogy sucks for first time users. They are presented with a wide range of options, a wall of jargon, and an unforgiving set of people, principles, and resources to master. What's worth, the assumption of many sites/products is that you are trying to become a hard-core genealogist, when this could not be further from the truth. You may just want to look up some information about your ancestor. Or you may want to learn about or read about what hapened in your ancestors life. You may be trying to explore and learn, not research and expand your tree. You may have no knowledge of latin or romanian, or you may be fluent in spanish and love puzzles. You may be at home with a mobile phone, instagram, and twitter, or you may be lost as soom as someone mentions a URL. You are unique, and it's high time we treated you that way. The reasons you want to connect with ancestors and other people are completely your own. The outcome you want is completely unique to you, and it's time that there was a product that let you get it. Something that catered to you. something that learns what you want. Something that finds out what you loke. Something that lears about you, and speaks to you in the way you understand. Something that asks you what you want and presents options for you to choose from. Something that lets you have fun and enjoy genealogy. Something that anticipates you, your needs, wants, and desires, and prenets genealogy to you in the way you want, understand, and need. You want anticipatory genealogy.

Genealogy software programs up to this point have been rigid and inflexible, requiring you to master a new language, jargon, methodology, and way of doing things. It is time for that to change. With the advent of AI, it is time to leverage that and integrate it into our genealogy process.Not just for matching algorithms and hinting, but putting those capabilities directly into the urser flow and letting AI manage the user experience and tailor it to the user. To ask and inquire what is wanted and needed, and then to use that (with additional feedback from actions) to shape the software's behavior. An AI that can guide a user from the very first interaction. Software that "asks" "what do YOU want to do", and then does it. software that is flexible. software that is responsive. Software that anticipates.

Take Bob. He is a 30 year old male that is comfortable with computers, is a bit of a history buff, and loves learning about his ancestors in the context of history. He doesn't much care for expanding his tree, but loves to get distracted learning about his ancestors.

And then there is Sue. She is a puzzle master, and does the daily crossword. She is 38, is married with 2 children, and is hooked on matching families with records. Give her a daily feed of discrete, bite sized relationship puzzles and she's as happy as a clam. If they are about her own family that's a bonus, but it's more about the puzzle than the person.

Now take Sally. She is the quintessential genealogist. Semi-retired at age 54, she is an experienced amatuer genealogist contemplating certification. She has more notes that you can shake a stick at, and loves compiling formal genealogies about her own family. She attends every conference she can, and is an avid evernote devotee.

And finally Bill. He is 16 and owns a smart phone but not a computer. He is curious about his grandparents, and would like to find his great grand-parents, but doesn't quite know where to start. He doesn't want to devote the hours-at-a-time it would take to dig in and learn, so he asks for guidance and help to both do and learn genealogy.

Sally, Bill, Sue, and Bob all have different backgrounds and want different things. They have varying levels of comfort with computers/technology, and their experience with genealogy and family history is all over the charts. Let's take a look at what anticipatory genealogy might look like for each of them...

Sally logs onto her computer and is presented with the list of projects she is working on, with a notification saying she has 2 messages. She opens the first, and reads that Tom, a researcher she was working with, has added some information to his tree supporting the death date and place of an ancestor that they have in common. She glances at the notes and citations, and pulls that information into her tree with a quick button click. The next message is a note from Bess. She found some information that seems to conflict with what Sally has in her tree, and wants to discuss possibilities. Sally pulls up her tree and looks at the conflict in context with both the new and old information, and notices an alert telling her that there is another discussion happening about the same piece of information. [The AI] must have found a high possiblity conflict and brought it to the attention of those who shared the same ancestor. After adding her two-cents and "watching" the conversation, she returns to her home screen. There she sees that [her AI] found another un-indexed record set that may shed some light on one of her projects. She pulls up that project and takes a look at her task list. 5 of 7 record sets searched. Yesterday there were only 6. Time to dive in and research, and she does...

Bill sits down for a break between his classes and pulls out his phone. There is a notification reminding him about his daily goal to do genealogy, and he clicks it. Today's task is figuring out if two people on two different census's 10 years apart are one and the same. High, medium, and low probablity are the possible answers for this one. The names are the same, as are the birth countries, but the birth years are way off. As he learned to do yesterday, he pulls up the family comparison and sees that all but one family member matches. The oldest daughter is not on the latter census. He notices that she was 14 on the last census, and it would make sense that she would be gone 10 years latter. He selects "high probability", knowing that this will feed into the pool of available matches for others to verify and eventually use. Checking his watch to make sure he has time for another, he starts reading. The names are spelled different, but sound the same...

Sue pulls out her tablet and opens up her current person-place puzzle. She has about 10 minutes before her youngest gets done with dance practice. "Good. 32/70 complete. Hmm. Anne born to John and Mary Smith. Elizabeth born to John and Mary Smith. Looks like just under 2 years apart, an easy one. Hyrum born to John and Anne Smith, but no other children for that couple. And a death of Anne Smith just after. And a Hyrum Smith. Oh, how sad. It's wondering if it's the same John Smith? Let me just check the timeline. Only two John Smith's in total, and there is a few years between John/Anne and John/Mary. High Probablity. And his new wife named the first daughter after his old wife. How touching..."

Bob leans back from his computer and stretches. Lunch break. He pulls out a muffin and cracks open his salad. "Oh good, grilled chicken. And she added avacados. Mmmmm." He logs on and selects Continue Reading.

From Wikipedia: German forces of the Fifth Panzer Army under Hasso von Manteuffel's command, primarily from the 2nd Panzer Division...

"Hmm. Hasso von Manteuffel. Sounds familiar. Oh look, Bastogne. That's where I remember him from. Hey Joe! Come and take a look at this..."

Although each of these examples sounds like it is coming from different programs, they all come from and feed the same base of information. Bill's learning and Sue's puzzles feed Sally's research, which allows Bob to enjoy learning about his relatives in the context of history. Each Person, with their own unique want and desire, contributes to the whole, and all benefit. All because each person's experience was tailored to their wants and adapted to their needs. And the more it learned about them and their ancestors, the more it is able to provide. Each new piece of information builds on the one prior, and each person provides more detail and information to draw from.

# How/Details?

At the core of anticipatory genealogy are two components: Discrete Actionable Tasks and Results Integration. Each is essential, and requires the other in order to be successful.

![](img/cycle.png)

The interplay between these two concepts is what powers Anticipatory Genealogy. Each completed task gives the system more information, and the system presents tasks that are more and more tailored to the Person's genealogical goals and aspirations.

### Discrete Actionable Tasks

The first component of Anticipatory Genealogy, Discrete Actionable Tasks, are exactly what they sound like. A Task is a piece of work to be done or undertaken, and in this case is specific to furthering a person's genealogy goals. And each Task is discrete, meaning individually separate and distinct. Each task is bounded and well defined, and there is a clear and obvious end result. Each Task is also actionable, meaning that the Task is able to be done or acted on; having practical value. What needs to be done to complete the task is obvious and possible given the current state of the system, and that action has an actual value to the system and the person.

Tasks may be created in one of three ways: through results integration, by the completion of another task, or by the explicit request of the user. The creation of tasks by results integration will be covered in the next section. The creation of a task via the completion of another task is best explained by example. Say that you are looking for evidence of a Birth. The System knows that there are two record sets to search, A and B, but you should only search B if A has no results. So a Task to search B would be created on the completion of the Task to search record set A results in the birth not being found. The creation of a Task by explicit user request is like when a user manually adds a task to a research Log. These tasks are still added to and integrated into the system, but they were not generated by the system.

**A Note about ambiguous Tasks**

One of the most annoying types of tasks to get is "Do X" with no specific guidelines as to how to complete the task. Example is find x person with no specific how tos. This type of task is specifically dissalowed by defninition, as it is not actionable. There is no specific instruction that the user can complete to satisfy this task. A grouping of tasks may have this overall goal, but don't make this a task please :)

**The lifecycle of a Task is as follows:**

![](img/task-lifecycle.png)

1. The Task is created.
2. The Task is made available to the Person.
3. The Task is completed.
4. The Task's result is integrated into the system.

**Task Components: A Task must contain at least the following:**

* Description of the task
* State of the task (Done/Not Done)
* Result of the task

**A Note About State**

Note no intermediate state/working. That is not allowed. Done or not. "In progress" is not handled by this system, but can be inferred by looking at a task series/tree as a whole. NOT in individual tasks.

**Task Organization**

May times it is useful to organize tasks into series, lists, trees, or other groupings to provide tracking details and other analysis capabilities.

The actual grouping is taken into account by the results integration step and will generate new tasks based off of the rules of the grouping. Discuss this more in Results Integration.

* Series - Steps that must be completed in order
* Tree - Mutually Exclusive Tasks based on previous choices
* List - Steps to be completed in any order
* Group - Mashup of above stuffs?

**Types of Tasks**

* Research Tasks
* Reading/Learning about Ancestor Tasks
* Learning how to do Genealogy Tasks
* Puzzle Tasks
* Direct Query Tasks (teach the System what you want, IE I want to do research on X line)

**Task Rejection**

There is an important case to consider when thinking about task completion: rejection. What happens when a user actively rejects a task. When they tell us that they have no interest in completing that particular task and dismiss it. This counts as a task completion and the state of the task is complete, but the result of the task is that the user rejected it. This information is taken into account by the Results Integration step to suggest (or not) additional tasks for the User to perform.

### Results Integration

The second major component of Anticipatory Genealogy is Results Integration. Again, fairly straightforward when you say it. It means that every task that has been completed is taken into account when providing additional tasks for the person to complete. But this information is not enough by itself. It must be combined with two other sources of information, tasks completed by other people and data/information available to the person.

![](img/integration-components.png)

**Knowledge of Person**

Information about the person is primarily obtained by the completion of Tasks. Some of these tasks may be direct queries, like are you interested in learning about history in the context of your genealogy. Others are derived from tasks that have been completed already, such as they completed the research on ancestor X from country Y, and there is some additional work to do for another ancestor in the same country. All of the completed and outstanding tasks are saved and taken into account when surfacing new tasks. 

**Knowledge of Other People**

The system takes into account what others have done in similar circumstances to provide accurate and useful tasks to the person. Knowing that people who like X also enjoy completing y is relevant and useful. This information can be obtained by examining other user's task lists using machine learning and other techniques. It can also be used to suggest collaboration opportunities and other interest overlaps to the person.

**Knowledge of Extant Data**

This is a knowledge of what data exists that can be leveraged and utilized both by and on behalf of the Person. It includes things like the state of the Person's Family Tree, what records are extant for a particular location and time, what data is available to explain events, times, and historical contexts to people, etc. It is the knowledge of information that can be shown to the user or searched by the user to further their goals.

**Process of Results Integration**

Just knowing about people and data does us no good unless we analyze that knowledge, draw conclusions and inferences, and use that information to benefit the user. So we take the information we have and generate a set of Tasks that we feel best suites the user at this time. We look at what we know about the user, what other users like him/her have done, and the data that is available to use and present the user with the set of tasks we think they would like best.
